                After working in financial services for a number of years I transitioned into
                working in tech as a software developer after attending the Develop Me tech
                accelerator course. Iâ€™m currently employed as a front-end developer working with
                JavaScipt technologies primarily React.

              I became interested into learning the skills required to be a software developer after
              experiences within the development process. Initially as an end user for a web app
              which was built for the team I was a part of and then working as a business analyst
              for a savings platform. I love learning about new technologies and have focused my
              efforts on JavaScript since becoming a developer, additionally I enjoy trying to
              improve my understanding and application of design.
